# DataCamp Visualization of Covid19

## Datasets 
All the datasets used are posted here for reproducibility. 


## Covid19 Jupyter Notebook 
Here you will find the algorithm in R, and the graphs to visualize the trends made with ggplot. 

## The point
Visualize COVID-19 data from the first several weeks of the outbreak to see at what point this virus became a global pandemic.
Can we see any effect from country-wide policies, like shutdowns and quarantines?
